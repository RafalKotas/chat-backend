# 3.6 UserRegistrationRequest — Registration Input DTO

`UserRegistrationRequest` is a **Data Transfer Object (DTO)** used to receive user input during the registration process.

It represents **external input from the client**, not a domain entity.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This DTO is responsible for:

- accepting user-provided registration data
- validating input at the API boundary
- protecting the domain model from malformed or unsafe data
- decoupling API contracts from persistence models

---

## 🧩 Fields Overview

```java
@Data
public class UserRegistrationRequest {

    @Email
    @NotBlank
    private String email;

    @NotBlank
    private String password;

    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private String username;
}
```

## 📌 Field Descriptions
### email
- Required
- Must be a valid email address
- Used as the primary login identifier
- Enforced as unique at the domain level

Validation:

```java
import jakarta.validation.constraints.Email;
import jakarta.validation.constraints.NotBlank;

@Email
@NotBlank
private String email;
```

---

### password
- Required
- Raw password provided by the user
- Will be hashed later in the authentication module
- Never persisted or returned in respones

Validation:

```java
import jakarta.validation.constraints.NotBlank;

@NotBlank
private String password;
```

---

### firstName / lastName
- Optional
- Used for display purposes
- Allows natural, human-readable identification

---

### username
- Optional
- Alternative display identifier
- If provided, must be unique
- Enables future features (mentions, search, profile URLs)

---

## 🔐 Security Notes
- DTO accepts raw password only at the API boundary
- Password hashing is handled later
- Password is never exposed outside registration flow

---

## 🧭 Summary
`UserRegistrationRequest` acts as a **protective layer** between the API and domain logic.

It ensures:
- clean input validation
- stable API contracts
- flexibility for future changes
