# UserRole - Domain Role Enumeration

This document describes the design and purpose of the `UserRole` enum.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

`UserRole` represents the **authorization level** of a user in the system.

It is intentionally simple at this early stage of the project.

---

## 📌 Why use an enum?

An enum ensures:
- type safety (no magic strings)
- clear and enforced possible values
- easy extension in the future
- readable storage in the database (`EnumType.STRING`)

Enums are ideal for representing *fixed sets of allowed values*.

---

## 🔐 Current values
```java
public enum UserRole {
    USER,
    ADMIN
}
```

### USER
The default role assigned to any newly registered user.

### ADMIN
Reserved for:
- system administrators
- moderation
- granting permissions to manage group chats or users (future feature)

---

## 🧱 Storage Strategy
The entity uses:

```java
import jakarta.persistence.EnumType;
import jakarta.persistence.Enumerated;

@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
```
This stores `"USER"` and `"ADMIN"` as clear strings in the database rather than numeric ordinals, which avoids:
- bugs when adding new roles
- unreadable values in the database
- issues caused by reordering enum items

---

## 🔮 Future expansion
Possible future roles:
- **MODERATOR** - manage group chats
- **SYSTEM** - internal system actions
- **READONLY** - disabled or restricted accounts

The enum approach supports this evolution cleanly.
