# 🧱 3.5 User Exceptions — Domain-Level Error Handling
This file documents the custom exceptions used in the **User domain**.

These exceptions ensure that the domain logic communicates errors clearly and predicatably, rather than relying on 
generic Java exceptions.

---

# ❗ Why Custom Exceptions?
Custom exceptions allow us to:
- express domain rule violations explicitly
- avoid ambiguous errors like `IllegalStateException`
- map failures cleanly to HTTP responses (e.g., **409 Conflict**)
- improve readability in logs
- simplify unit testing
- keep controller/service layers clean and intention-revealing

## 📌 `EmailAlreadyUsedException`

### When it is thrown

When attempting to register a new user with an email that already exists in the system.

### Why

Email must be unique for:
- login
- account recovery
- identity verification

### Constructor example
```java
public class EmailAlreadyUsedException extends RuntimeException {
    public EmailAlreadyUsedException(String email) {
        super("Email already in use: " + email);
    }
}
```

## 📌 `UsernameAlreadyUsedException`

### When it is thrown

When a user attempts to register with a username that already exists.

### Why

Although username is optional, if provided it must be unique for:
- profile identification
- chat labeling
- future features (mentions, search)

### Constructor example
```java
public class UsernameAlreadyUsedException extends RuntimeException {
    public UsernameAlreadyUsedException(String username) {
        super("Username already in use: " + username);
    }
}
```

---

## 🌱 Future Exceptions (planned)
As the user module grows, more domain exceptions may be added, such as:
- `InvalidPasswordException`
- `UserNotFoundException`
- `UserDisabledException`
- `InvalidNameFormatException`

These will follow the same conventions.

---

## ✅ Summary

These exceptions ensure that the **UserService** enforces domain logic in a consistent and expressive way.

They help maintain:
- clean service code
- predictable controller behavior
- meaningful API messages
- better developer experience
