# application.yaml - Spring Boot Configuration

This document explains the purpose and structure of the `application.yaml` file used by the Spring Boot backend.

---

## 📍 Location

```
src/main/resources/application.yaml
```

---

## ❓ What is application.yaml?

`application.yaml` is the main configuration file for a Spring Boot application. It defines:
- how the application connects to the database
- how JPA and Hibernate behave
- which port the server runs on

Spring Boot reads this file automatically at startup.

---

## 🧩 Database Configuration

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/<DB_NAME>
    username: <DB_USERNAME>
    password: <DB_PASSWORD>
```

### Explanation:
- **url** - The JDBC connection string that tells Spring Boot where the PostgreSQL database is running (host + port) and
which database schema it should connect to
- **username** - The database user account that Spring Boot authenticates as when opening a JDBC connection. This user 
must exist in PostgreSQL and must have permission to create, update, and query tables.
- **password** - The password for the database user. This value is **sensitive** and must **never** be committed to the 
repository. It should be supplied via environment variables, Docker secrets, a `.env` file (ignored by Git), or secrets 
manager.

These placeholders (`DB_NAME`, `<DB_USERNAME>`, `<DB_PASSWORD>`) are used in the tutorial to avoid exposing credentials 
publicly. The actual values are provided outside the repository.

These values must match the configuration in `docker-compose.yml`.

## 🧩 JPA / Hibernate Configuration

```yaml
spring:
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
    properties:
      hibernate:
        dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
```

### Explanation
- **ddl-auto: update** - Hibernate will automatically create or update database tables based on your entity classes.
- **dialect** - Instructs Hibernate how to generate SQL specifically for PostgreSQL.

## 🌐 Server Configuration

```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
```

Your backend application will be available at:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

---

## ✅ Result

With this configuration:
- Spring Boot can successfully connect to PostgreSQL
- JPA entities are mapped to database tables
- the application can run without manual SQL setup

This file will be extended later as security, profiles, and logging are added.
